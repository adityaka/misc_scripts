# Question Bank

## SUMMARY

This is a practice question bank which I have gathered based on different experiences around taking or giving interviews at various places. Rest of the project contains the solutions to the problems documented here. This kind of becomes a common place 
for solved excecises which helps in many places. 

## CODING PROBLEMS

P-1 Given a list of natural numbers, find the missing number in O(n) complexity.
P-2 Given a Binary Tree, find out if the leaves have even and odd pattern. The tree need not be balanced?
P-2 Given two Lists A and B of integers. For each element (E) in A find nearest element(En) in B.
    The nearest term is defined by minimum value of |E - En|.
P-3 Given a rooted n-ary tree (any arbitrary width/depth) find out if the sub-tree based on a filter. e.g.
            1
    /   /  / \  \  \
   2  3   4   5  6  7
/ / \ 
8 9 10

filter criteriea find odd nodes 

        1
    /  / \
   3  5   7  
   /
   9 

P-4 Given a Deck of cards, write a program to distrubte cards. Number of cards and number of players will be specified as inputs.
   Constraints : 
   1. None of the players should get same amount of cards
   1. Assume there is only one deck of cards

## DESIGN PROBLEMS

P-5 Design a game of Snakes and Ladders
P-6 Design a Distro pipeline. You are a CI/CD developer. There is a need to generate a custom distro autmatically for any flavor of linux. Create a System which can generate a distro package it and deploy it.
