# C++ Prep and Learning

Basic ideas of c++ are under basic_cpp. 
DataStructures are spread across.
include was an attempt to have most headers but they are scattered across.

## TODO 
 - Write Doublelist and SingleList 
 - Write Stack and Queues with Lists
 - Write a Hashtable implementation
 - Trees should be in sparate folder reuse the Node.hh
 - Graphs should be in separate folder reuse Node.hh

## Sanitization Tak
 - Rename node.hh to Node.hh 
 - The CMAKE file is bulky but let it be that way it's easier to add things at a single place. In Future we can breakdown the cmakes into different projects and port the cmake changes
